# Battle-City_Multiplayer

It is a multiple-player game. 

Firstly run TankServer.java. Then after the server runs succeefully, players can run TankClient.java to participate in this battle. 

Players need to press "C" to motify their UDP Ports before they begin game. 

Tanks can run by pressing up, down, left and right.

Tanks can attack others by pressing "Z".

Compared with the single version, for simplification, I didn't add pictures for tanks and missiles.
