# Battle-City_Multiplayer

This is a updated version of Battle City, which allows multiple-players to involve in. 

Firstly run TankServer.java. Then after the server runs succeefully, players can run TankClient.java to participate in this battle. 

Players need to press "C" to motify their UDP Ports before they begin game. 

Tanks can run by pressing up, down, left and right.

Tanks can attack others by pressing "Z".

The graphical aspect of the game doesn't change too much compared with previous single-player version, however, for simplification, I didn't add any graphics for tanks and missiles.
